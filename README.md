# greedy
Solving optimization problems using Greedy algorithms and dynamic programming.
The coin_change function demonstrates a greedy algorithm for solving the coin change problem, where given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, it finds the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount.

The fibonacci function demonstrates dynamic programming to efficiently compute the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.

Both algorithms are implemented separately and serve different purposes. Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum, while dynamic programming breaks down a problem into simpler subproblems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computation.
